# Housing-Price-Predictor

## This project is a Linear Regression Model built to predict the sale price of residential homes using the Ames Housing Dataset. By leveraging a wide range of categorical and numerical features, the model uses Linear Regression to estimate housing prices with a focus on accuracy and interpretability

## Model: Linear Regression

## Dataset: Ames Housing Dataset

## Preprocessing:

### Dropped irrelevant features
### Handled missing data with appropriate strategies (e.g., mean imputation, 'Not Available')
### Applied normalization techniques such as z-score scaling and log transformation
### One-hot encoded categorical variables

## Feature Engineering:

### Grouped and labeled categorical features
### Scaled the target variable (sale price) for improved model performance

## Evaluation:

### Random Forest RMSE: 0.25795381307854687
### Random Forest MAE: 0.18860455948688243
### Random Forest R2 Score: 0.9434330669349795

## Objective:

### To build a clean and modular machine learning pipeline capable of accurately predicting home sale prices and generalizing well to unseen data.
